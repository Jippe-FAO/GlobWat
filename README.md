# GlobWat

GlobWat is a soil water balance model to assess water use in irrigated agriculture, described in Hoogeveen et al., 2015.
Input layers and parameters, output data, and model code are freely distributed through FAO GeoNetwork spatial data catalogue  and FAO AQUAmaps, spatial water data explorer . The output data made available for distribution refer to global water use in irrigation around the year 2005 and are based on long term climatic averages.
This repository contains the FORTRAN code and executables. Input and output data are available through FAO AQUAmaps at http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquamaps/
